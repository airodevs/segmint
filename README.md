# Segmint
Segmint is an easy-to-use landing page framework, allowing quick and efficient prototyping and deployment - perfect for freelancers and product launch pages, alongside portfolios, resumes, and much more. Our simple module-based system allows effortless expansion and ability to develop third party "segmints" for others to incorporate into their own pages.

Documentation is currently sparse but will be continually updated with any changes to the software.

Versions whose secondary version numbers differ (i.e. 1.x) will be incompatible with each other and minor alterations by the administrator may need to be made to the existing installation. Minor updates, such as from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2` should have no compatibility issues.
> This will change when cohesive update systems are put in place in future revisions.

## Installation
> Prerequisites: MySQL, PHP 7.1
